					<h2>Why Boon?</h2>
					<p>
						Getting started in the music industry, either as an artist or as a venue can be a daunting
						task... there is no blueprint as to how to get yourself out there, and the blueprint that exists
						involves a third party promoter that rarely benefits the artist. As a venue, there is no easy
						way to gain access to artists conveniently and quickly. Boon works to solve all of
						these issues by simply providing connections and a place to get started.

					</p>
					<p>
						Boon provides the solution for small artists and venues for getting started in the
						industry, but we also provide this solution in a way that respects the relationship between
						artist and venue. As a community founded by artists looking for venues, we understand the flaws
						of the current climate and are looking to make a change in the way that networking is done in
						the industry for the better.

					</p>
					<p>
						Through Boon, an artist will be able to expand their music network across all cities,
						giving them the chances that they deserve or otherwise may not be able have.
